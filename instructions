Portfolio construction:
1. Create two subsamples using the top 50% ME and bottom 50% ME stocks.
    For each subsample.
          a. Use J = 12 months formation period to create decile portfolios.
          b. Buy `winners' portfolio and sell `losers' one and hold position for K = 1 month.
          c. Roll the window by 1 month and repeat 1 and 2 until end of sample.
          
Trading strategies:
At beginning of each month from Jan 1991 to Dec 2014
1. Remove stocks with at least one missing price in the past J = 12 months.
2. Sort the remaining stocks (ascending) by their return over the past J = 12
months.
3. Group them by decile and create 10 equally weighted portfolios.
4. Buy bottom decile (winners) portfolio and sell top decile (losers) portfolio.
5. Hold position for K = 1 month and close position of previous month.
Every month you completely rebalance your portfolio by closing the strategy
formed the previous month and opening the newly formed one.
6. Repeat steps 1-5.
