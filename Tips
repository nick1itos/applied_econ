Panel dataset:
-Stocks are indexed by permno and date.
-Make sure data are sorted (ascending) by permno and date. - ?order
-Merge F-F5 factors and ME breakpoints. - ?merge
-Create vector of return and other relevant variables.
    Brute force. - for loop indexing permno and date
    Smart. - R packages: dplyr, data.table
-Create tags for missing values - ?is.na
-Other useful functions: ?quantile, ?cumprod, ?cumsum

Dynamic trading strategy:
    Decile (and hence portfolio) composition changes at each month.
    Bear in mind when analysing strategies and reporting the average number of
    stocks within each decile
    
Wait and trade:
-Note there is delay between the signal and actual trade.
-Skip the previous month in the formation of the strategy.

When analysing strategies in R:
-It might be easier to `transpose' the dataset in order to have strategies as
columns and dates as rows - ?reshape
-Some R utilities might require variables to be transformed in time-series - can
be done with packages: xts, zoo
